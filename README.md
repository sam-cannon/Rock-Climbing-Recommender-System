# Rock-Climbing-Recommender-System
Development of a recommender system for rock climbs. This recommender system is being developed for https://openbeta.io/explorer?boulder=true&sport=true&tr=true&trad=true. I am working on this with https://github.com/JeffMacaluso who, lets be honest, will probably be coming up with most of the cutting edge work ;)
